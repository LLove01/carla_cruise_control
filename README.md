# carla_cruise_control  

The purpose of this project is implementing autonomous driving in the Carla simulator.

Project is useful for beginners as their introduction into various fields surrounding the problem. This includes computer vision, artificial inteligence, signal and image processing, control systems ...

Users can utilise project for improving their own implementations of Carla projects including autonomous driving subproblems such as lane detection, braking based on radar data, PID controller, collecting and processing sensor data.

Implementation is intended for usage exclusively in the Carla simulator.
